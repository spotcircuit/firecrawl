# ðŸ”¥ Firecrawl

Firecrawl is a minimal, Vercel-hosted static site that serves dynamically generated HTML result pages.

It is designed to integrate with automated scraping or extraction workflows (e.g., via [n8n](https://n8n.io/)) where results are published to this repository and auto-deployed by Vercel.

## ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure


- All HTML result pages are stored in `public/results/`
- Pages are served from Vercel at:  
  `https://firecrawl.vercel.app/results/{filename}.html`

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This repo is auto-deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com).  
Every push to `main` triggers a redeploy.

## ðŸ¤– Automation

The HTML result files are committed to this repo via the GitHub REST API.
